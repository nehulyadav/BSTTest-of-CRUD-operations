# BST Test of CRUD operations

The Java project provides a menu driven interface that allows a user to exercise the below mentioned operations on a binary search tree of integers. The project implements a class called BinarySearchTree for representing binary search trees of integers. The class supports the following operations:

1. Creation - allows a user to create an empty binary search tree.
2. Insertion - allows a user to insert a single integer into the tree.
3. Contains - allows a user to check if an integer belongs to the tree.
4. Delete - allows a user to delete a single integer from the tree.

In addition, the class supports the ability to print the contents of the tree using a preorder, postorder, or inorder traversal.
